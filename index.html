            Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me "Go make yourself some
            friends, or you'll be lonely" Once, I was seven years old
          </div>

          <div class="33">
            It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger Pushing each
            other to the limits, we were learning quicker By 11, smoking herb
            and drinking burning liquor Never rich, so we were out to make that
            steady figure
          </div>

          <div class="49">
            Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me "Go get yourself a wife,
            or you'll be lonely" Once, I was 11 years old
          </div>

          <div class="65">
            I always had that dream like my daddy before me So I started writing
            songs, I started writing stories Something about the glory just
            always seemed to bore me 'Cause only those I really love will ever
            really know me
          </div>

          <div class="81">
            Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told Before the morning sun,
            when life was lonely Once, I was 20 years old
          </div>

          <div class="97">
            I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure 'Cause I know the
            smallest voices, they can make it major I got my boys with me, at
            least those in favor And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope
            I'll see you later
          </div>

          <div class="113">
            Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told I was writing 'bout
            everything, I saw before me Once, I was 20 years old

          <div class="128">
            Soon, we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold We've traveled
            around the world, and we're still roaming Soon, we'll be 30 years
            old

            ( Noruto fans ready!! ) I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me So I
            can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories Most of my
            boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory And some I had to
            leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry
          </div>

            your life becomes a better one I made the man so happy when I wrote
            a letter once I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a
            month
